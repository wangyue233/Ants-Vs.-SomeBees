# Ants-Vs.-SomeBees
Coursework for self-studying UC Berkeley's CS61A in Spring 2018 (WIP)
this project is to develop a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees through Python. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
# The command to run it is:

The tool includes tests, which you can use to check its operation on your system. With the code compiled, these can be run 
with

```
python3 gui.py [-h] [-d DIFFICULTY] [-w] [--food FOOD]
